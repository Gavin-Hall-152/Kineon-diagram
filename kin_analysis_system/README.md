## Features

- **Next.js 13+ App Router**: Modern routing with React Server Components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code to prevent common errors
- **API Structure**: Well-organized API endpoints with validation
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components
- **Custom Hooks**: For state and API management
- **Service Layer**: Abstraction for data fetching
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable helper functions

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Best Practices

This project follows these best practices:

1. **Component Organization**: Components are organized by feature and reusability
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout the project
3. **API Abstractions**: API calls are abstracted in service layers
4. **Custom Hooks**: Business logic is extracted into reusable hooks
5. **Code Splitting**: For improved performance
6. **Consistent Styling**: Using Tailwind CSS with proper organization

## Folder Structure Details

### `/src/app`

Contains all the pages and API routes using Next.js App Router pattern.

### `/src/components`

Reusable components organized by purpose:

- `/ui`: Basic UI components like buttons, inputs, etc.
- Feature-specific components for different sections of the application

### `/src/hooks`

Custom React hooks for state management, API calls, and other reusable logic.

### `/src/services`

Services for interacting with external APIs and data sources.

### `/src/types`

TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application.

### `/src/utils`

Helper functions and utilities.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
