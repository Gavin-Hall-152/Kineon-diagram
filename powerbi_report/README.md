# Power BI Reports

This folder contains all the Power BI (`.pbix`) report files created by team members for the project dashboards.

## Folder Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to store and version control Power BI report files developed by the frontend team.

Since `.pbix` files are binary and cannot be merged like source code, we enforce the workflow of having only one person work on a Power BI report at a time to avoid merge conflicts and accidental overwrites.

## Workflow Guideline

> ⚠️ Important: Always coordinate with the team before starting work on any Power BI report.

### Steps to add/update a Power BI report:
1. Pull the latest version of `power_bi_dashboard` branch.
2. Place or update your `.pbix` file in this folder (`powerbi_report/`).
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Update your changes in the opened pull request

## Notes
- Use clear and descriptive filenames for your reports.
- Avoid working on the same report file simultaneously.
- If multiple reports are related, discuss and align on report ownership before starting work.
